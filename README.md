# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
My experimental game support profiles and works. This branch contains my TrenchBroom add ons for my friend, Renny's games & mods.
<hr style="width:50%">

These are written for TB GameConfig syntax version 9, meant to be used with TrenchBroom 2024.2 or [newer 2025 releases](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) to function as intended. Always use [current builds](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) for all the latest addtions, improvements and bug fixes.

#### Committed game profile so far :

<img src="/games/RenRacer/Icon.png"  width="16" height="16">&nbsp;<a href="/games/RenRacer/">RenRacer</a><br>

#### Coming in future commits :

### How-to-Install
You can either grab individual files, but everything is needed inside of the game profile dir to work properly. You can grab the full RenegadeC branch with all commited games support files include with this <a href="https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/archive/refs/heads/RenegadeC.zip">link</a>, then just copy the games/profile folders you want out into your `TrenchBroom/games` dir.
Best to install add-ons in the user TB data saving location.

**Linux** users should copy the folder Quake2RE from the and all its contents to your TB Home dir game data :

### `~/.TrenchBroom/games/`

For windows users copy them to :

### `%appdata%\TrenchBroom\games\`
