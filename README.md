# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
My experimental game support profiles and works.
<br><br>
These won't work with TrenchBroom 2023.1 release version and will require a [recent dev build](https://github.com/kduske/TrenchBroom/releases) from the most recent or close enough TrenchBroom commits to function. It has the recent bug fixes, additions, and I would rather support that since it is what I use vs stale releases. 

For my Arch Linux and Arch based, Manjaro, etc based distro fellows you can build TrenchBroom with most current commits for your system with the [trenchbroom-git AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trenchbroom-git) I co-maintain.

Committed game profile so far :
