# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
### My experimental game support profiles and works.

These work only with TrenchBroom 2024.1 release version or newer releases which can include dev builds to function properly.

- For my Arch Linux and Arch based, Manjaro, etc based distro fellows you can install TrenchBroom current releaae with [trenchbroom-bin AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trenchbroom-bin) I co-maintain. OR the dev build I maintain here: [trenchbroom-git AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trenchbroom-git)

#### Committed game profile so far :

### How-to-Install
You can either grab individual files, but everything is needed inside of the game profile dir to work properly. You can grab the full [zip](https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and just copy the game profile folder you want out into your `TrenchBroom/games` dir.

### Help & Stuff
TrenchBroom is more akin to Blender IMO then say something like [Quark](https://quark.sourceforge.io/), [WorldCraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20060530014852/http://hosted.planetquake.gamespy.com/worldcraft/index2.shtm), or [BSP](https://www.bspquakeeditor.com/index.php).
Learning a new program, a workflow takes time and some patience, and these tutorials are very Quake centric videos, but you can look beyond that these go into detail how to get things done in 
TrenchBroom. Dumptruck's stuff is the tried and true recommendation to get started working with TB. Markie's SlipSeer videos go a bit beyond and show you a few more advanced things that can be done. Both worth watching.
