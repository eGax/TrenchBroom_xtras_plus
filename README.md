### My experimental game support profiles and works for Nazi Zombies: Portable.

These are written for TB GameConfig syntax version 9, meant to be used with TrenchBroom 2025.2 or [newer 2025 releases](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) to function as intended. Always use [current builds](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) for all the latest addtions, improvements and bug fixes.<br>

FYI the official Linux TB precompiled build is now an x86_64 AppImage making it easy running for current distros.

#### This is my committed game profile for NZP with improvements to the FGDs and GameConfig.cfg :<br><br>

<hr>

This a is a working WIP and meant to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/maraakate/NZP">Unofficial NZP v1.3 Patch</a> or newer. It brings Linux, Mac, and improved Windows engine ports, fixed up maps, and game code. You can read about it and grab it from their github.

### How-to-Install
You can either grab individual files from the branch/games dirs, but everything is needed inside of the game profile dir to work properly. You can grab all directly from the branch downloads above, then just copy the games/profile folders you want out into your `TrenchBroom/games` dir.
Best to install add-ons in the user TB data saving location.

**Linux** users should copy the folder NZP from the zip and all its contents to your TB Home dir game data :

### `~/.TrenchBroom/games/`

For windows users copy them to :

### `%appdata%\TrenchBroom\games\`

## Help & Stuff
TrenchBroom is more akin to Blender IMO then say something like [Quark](https://quark.sourceforge.io/), [WorldCraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20060530014852/http://hosted.planetquake.gamespy.com/worldcraft/index2.shtm), or [BSP](https://www.bspquakeeditor.com/index.php).
Learning a new program, a workflow takes time and some patience, and these tutorials are very Quake centric videos, but you can look beyond that these go into detail how to get things done in 
TrenchBroom. Dumptruck's stuff is the tried and true recommendation to get started working with TB. Markie's SlipSeer videos go a bit beyond and show you a few more advanced things that can be done. Both worth watching.
