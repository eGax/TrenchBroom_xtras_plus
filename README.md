# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
### My experimental game support profiles and works.

These won't work with TrenchBroom 2023.1 release version or previous builds and will require a [recent dev build](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/actions/runs/5419925551) from the most recent or close enough TrenchBroom commits to function. It has the recent bug fixes, additions, a slightly different gameconfig syntax and I would rather support 1 version of each config since it is what I use vs stale releases. You will need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the compiled build at the bottom labeled as `Artifacts` to download.

- For my Arch Linux and Arch based, Manjaro, etc based distro fellows you can build TrenchBroom with most current commits for your system with the [trenchbroom-git AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trenchbroom-git) I co-maintain.

#### Committed game profile so far :

- [MarbleBlast](https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/tree/main/games_wip/MarbleBlast)

#### Coming in future commits :
- [GravityBone](https://store.steampowered.com/app/974090/Gravity_Bone/)
- [The Ascension of Vigil](https://github.com/RennyC4/TAoV)
- [RenRacer ᴬᴷᴬ RageRacer](https://github.com/RennyC4/RenRacer)

### Help & Stuff
TrenchBroom is more akind to Blender IMO then say something like [Quark](https://quark.sourceforge.io/), [WorldCraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20060530014852/http://hosted.planetquake.gamespy.com/worldcraft/index2.shtm), or [BSP](https://www.bspquakeeditor.com/index.php).
Learning a new program, a workflow takes time and some patience, and these tutorials are very Quake centric videos, but you can look beyond that these go into detail how to get things done in 
TrenchBroom. Dumptruck's stuff is the tried and true recommendation to get started working with TB. Markie's SlipSeer videos go a bit beyond and show you a few more advanced things that can be done. Both worth watching.
