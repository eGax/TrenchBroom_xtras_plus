# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
### My experimental game support profiles and works.

These are written for TB GameConfig syntax version 9, meant to be used with TrenchBroom 2024.2 or [newer 2025 releases](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) to function as intended. Always use [current builds](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases) for all the latest addtions, improvements and bug fixes.<br>

FYI the official Linux TB precompiled build is now an x86_64 AppImage making it easy running for current distros.

#### Committed game profile so far as grouped into different branches :

### How-to-Install
You can either grab individual files, but everything is needed inside of the game profile dir to work properly. You can grab the ip) currently to get both, then just copy the game profile folders you want out into your `TrenchBroom/games` dir. The rest are in their individual branches were you can download them zipped, from git, or individual files. Here are links to download them directly zipped. [Quake2RE](https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/archive/refs/heads/Quake2RE.zip), [WolfET](https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/archive/refs/heads/WolfET.zip), and [both Jedi games](https://github.com/eGax/TrenchBroom_xtras_plus/archive/refs/heads/Jedi.zip) in same branch download.

### Help & Stuff
TrenchBroom is more akin to Blender IMO then say something like [Quark](https://quark.sourceforge.io/), [WorldCraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20060530014852/http://hosted.planetquake.gamespy.com/worldcraft/index2.shtm), or [BSP](https://www.bspquakeeditor.com/index.php).
Learning a new program, a workflow takes time and some patience, and these tutorials are very Quake centric videos, but you can look beyond that these go into detail how to get things done in 
TrenchBroom. Dumptruck's stuff is the tried and true recommendation to get started working with TB. Markie's SlipSeer videos go a bit beyond and show you a few more advanced things that can be done. Both worth watching.
