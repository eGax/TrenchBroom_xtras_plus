# **TrenchBroom xtras plus**
### My experimental game support profiles and works.

These won't work with TrenchBroom 2023.1 release version or previous builds and will require a [recent dev build](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/actions/runs/5419925551) from the most recent or close enough TrenchBroom commits to function. It has the recent bug fixes, additions, a slightly different gameconfig syntax and I would rather support 1 version of each config since it is what I use vs stale releases. You will need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the compiled build at the bottom labeled as `Artifacts` to download.

- For my Arch Linux and Arch based, Manjaro, etc based distro fellows you can build TrenchBroom with most current commits for your system with the [trenchbroom-git AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trenchbroom-git) I co-maintain.
