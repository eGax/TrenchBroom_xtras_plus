DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION for weapons, ammo, and item pickups.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.
The NOPLAYER flag makes it so player cannot pick it up.

USEPICKUP - Player must be holding "use" to pick it up
STATIONARY - Cannot be moved around by force push/pull, radius damage, knockback, etc...

If an item is the target of another entity, it will spawn as normal, use INVISIBLE to hide it.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
"random" random number of plus or minus seconds varied from the respawn time
"count" override quantity or duration on most items.

Reference tags which can be positioned throughout the level.
These tags can later be refered to by the scripting system

If you set angles on the tag, these will be retained.

If you target a ref_tag at an entity, that will set the ref_tag's
angles toward that entity.

If you set the ref_tag's ownername to the ownername of an entity,
it makes that entity is the owner of the ref_tag.  This means 
that the owner, and only the owner, may refer to that tag.

Tags may not have the same name as another tag with the same
owner.  However, tags with different owners may have the same
name as one another.  In this way, scripts can generically 
refer to tags by name, and their owners will automatically
specifiy which tag is being referred to.
