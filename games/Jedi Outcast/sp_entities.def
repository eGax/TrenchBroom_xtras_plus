DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION for weapons, ammo, and item pickups.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.
The STARFLEET flag allows only starfleets to pick it up.
The MONSTER flag allows only NON-starfleets to pick it up.

If an item is the target of another entity, it will spawn as normal, use INVISIBLE to hide it.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
"random" random number of plus or minus seconds varied from the respawn time
"count" override quantity or duration on most items.

If you set an angle on the trigger, they're only hidden from enemies looking in that direction.  the player's crouch viewheight is 36, his standing viewheight is 54.  So a trigger thast should hide you when crouched but not standing should be 48 tall.
"target2"	The trigger will fire this only when the trigger has been activated and subsequently 'cleared'( once any of the conditions on the trigger have not been satisfied).  This will not fire the "target" more than once until the "target2" is fired (trigger field is 'cleared')
"speed"		How many seconds to wait to fire the target2, default is 1

LINEAR - Instead of tossing the client at the target_position, it will push them towards it.  Must set a "speed" (see below)
