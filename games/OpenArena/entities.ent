  <group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0" model="">
Compiler-only entity. Specifies a decal for projection.

A decal is created by grouping one or more bezier patches and targetting it into an info_null entity. Axis and distance of projection are determined by the distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target.

Compiler-only entity. Specifies the origin of a skybox in a contained area of the map, far from the actual level.

A skybox casts shadows on normal parts of the map and allows the use of cloud layers and other effects. After compiling, the skybox will replace any sky shaders present in the map, except, of course, those in the skybox itself.

Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps.

This entity requires an origin. It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.
The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.
This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity.

Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking.

<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="Don't drop to ground" bit="0">If set, the item will not drop to the ground. Bots will ignore it.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

  <group name="worldspawn" color="0 0 0" model="">
The main entity of the map. Every map should have exactly one worldspawn.
-------- KEYS --------
<real key="_ambient;ambient" name="Ambient Intensity">Constant value added to the overall lighting. Use not recommended, since ambient light has a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.</real>
<integer key="_blocksize" name="Block Size">Size of the blocks q3map2 vis uses in order to calculate what's drawn in the screen. Higher values than the default are recommended for very large maps with low structural brush count. The calculation is based on the formulas X=_blocksize*n; Y=_blocksize*n.. Default: 1024.</integer>
<color key="_color" name="Ambient Color">Color of the ambient light.. Default: 0 0 0.</color>
<integer key="enableBreath" name="Enable Breathing">Enables a cough-like effect for the characters. Mostly used for ice maps.</integer>
<integer key="enableDust" name="Enable Dust">Enables footstep-based dust from surfaces marked as such.</integer>
<integer key="enableFS" name="Enable Fanservice">Enables summer effects for characters in the map, if available. (FS=fanservice)</integer>
<integer key="enableQ" name="Enable Q1-Scale">Enables a Q1-like perspective. Mostly used for debugging.</integer>

<string key="message" name="Logon Message">Name of the map. Displayed on the loading screen.</string>
<integer key="_castshadows;_cs" name="Shadow Caster Level">Per-entity control over shadow casting. The values it can take are:

<real key="_mingridlight" name="Min Dynamic Intensity">Minimum value of dynamic entity lighting, level-wide.</real>
<real key="_minlight" name="Min Lightmap Intensity">Minimum value of world-wide lighting, level-wide, which uses ''_color'' to add a color to the ambience. Unlike _ambient and ambient, it does not add values to the other light entities.</real>
<real key="_minvertexlight" name="Min Vertex Intensity">Minimum value of vertex lighting, level-wide.</real>
<boolean key="_noshadersun" name="Ignore Shader Sun">Ignores the sky properties of the sky shaders, and ONLY uses entity sun lights.</boolean>
<integer key="_receiveshadows;_rs" name="Shadow Reception Level">Per-entity control over shadow reception. The values it can take are:

* 0: Doesn't receive shadows.

* Range (0,1): Receive shadows from both entities with _cs or _castshadows and world.

* 1: Receive shadows on everything (world shadows). This is the default value.
