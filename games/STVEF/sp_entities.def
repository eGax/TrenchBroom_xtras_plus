DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION for weapons, ammo, and item pickups.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.
The STARFLEET flag allows only starfleets to pick it up.
The MONSTER flag allows only NON-starfleets to pick it up.

If an item is the target of another entity, it will spawn as normal, use INVISIBLE to hide it.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
