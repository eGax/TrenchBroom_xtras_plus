/*QUAKED ammo_bullets (.3 .3 1) (-20 -20 -16) (20 20 20) SUSPENDED
Pistol ammo. Gives the player 12 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 50).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

team: assign the same team name to multiple doors that should operate together (see Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/
