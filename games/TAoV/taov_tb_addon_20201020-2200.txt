 
This is a custom game profile for the TrenchBroom map editor versions 2020.2+ to create maps for the standalone
game The Ascension of Vigil. A side-scrolling beat'm up running in the FTE game engine that initially began
development way back in October of 2004. There has been long gaps in activity over the years until only
recently in 2019 there is renewed life in the project. It's very playable, but far from done the game
development is on going and somethings are subject to change over time. The biggest block in development
has been maps or mappers available to map for the game. This game profile was created for TrenchBroom is an attempt
to help lower that bar to map making.

Inside this archive is a folder named, "taov" that folder as is with its contents needs to be uncompressed
and placed into you TrenchBroom game config location to be able to use this game profile to create TAoV maps.

To install this into your TrenchBroom for Linux users with TrenchBroom not running place the "taov" folder inside:

/home/yourusername/.TrenchBroom/games/


On windows it goes inside here:

/Users/yourusername/AppData/Roaming/TrenchBroom/games/

Now it is installed:

-Run TB,
-Click the [New map...] button from the welcome screen,
-highlight the TAoV game profile,
-Click the [Open preferences...] button,
-Select TAoV and set the game path to where you extracted the game and the game engine to TAoV.exe for windows or the TAoV for Linux.
-Click OK to save changes and you are ready to start making new a map.

By default the TAoV game profile defaults to and favors the Valve texture coordinate format. Starting a new map you will be presented with a starter template map. The game's map sources are also included
for examples of what types of maps are possible. This profile is a WIP, will be adjusted as game changes happen, bugs found, etc.
If you use it and find issues we would appreciate constructive feedback so it can be improved.
