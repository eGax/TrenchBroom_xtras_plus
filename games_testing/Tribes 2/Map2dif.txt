Synopsis:
A short tutorial describing how to set up Valves Hammer Editor for the creation of Torque DIF files.

Keywords:
Hammer Worldcraft DIF map2dif

Article:
There seems to have been a resource covering this but I could not find it (broken link) so had to do this the hard way, To save you some time this is what I came up with .....

There have been concerns in the past about licensing issues using Hammer, for more info see www.garagegames.com/index.php?sec=mg&mod=resource&page=view&qid=2497

For this HowTo: it is expected that the Torque SDK has been installed at C:\Torque_SDK

Download Hammer from collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?go=hammer

Run the install but do not run the application yet.....

Assuming you installed to the default location: C:\Program Files\Valve Hammer Editor

Create a new directory: C:\Program Files\Valve Hammer Editor\fgd\Torque

Copy or Create torque.fgd in/to the above directory, you can find it in C:\Torque_SDK\tools\map2dif\

Hammer uses textures contained in a .wad file, so you will need to create a file for hammer to use.

There are two options ....

1. Use wally www.telefragged.com/wally/
2. Use the buildwad tool included with torque. (find it in C:\Torque_SDK\tools)

Create a wad file containing at least one texture.

Create a working directory C:\test

Copy the texture(s) you put into the wad file into this directory, map2dif will need to use them during its DIF creation.

Copy map2dif_plus.exe to C:\Program Files\Valve Hammer Editor\tools
This file can be found in C:\Torque_SDK\tools (after you have compiled the Torque SDK) else you can download it from www.garagegames.com/mg/projects/tge/artist.php#DIF

Start Hammer,

The configuration dialog should already be open, else open from Tools/options menu.

On the Textures tab hit the Add WAD button and locate the wad file you just created.
On the Build Programs tab under CSG executable hit the browse button and locate C:\Program Files\Valve Hammer Editor\tools\map2dif_plus.exe
You can leave all the other paths here blank.
hit ok.

Now to create a test map/room,

1. Select menu File/new
2. Ensure you have the block tool selected (white cube icon on left-hand icon list).
3. In the top view drag out a box (top view is the top right pane).
4. In the side view (lower right pane) drag the top handle up (small white dot) to make the box a bit larger.
5. Right click inside the box and select "create object".
6. Select the selection tool (the red arrow icon on left-hand icon list).
7. Select the box by clicking on one of it lines or the little "x" in the middle (it will turn red).
8. Select menu Tools/Make Hollow (or hit CTRL+H), keep the default 32 value and hit ok.
9. Re-select the box, and right click it, select ungroup from the drop-down menu (or hit CTRL+U).
10. Un-select the box by clicking away from it.
11. Select the end wall by clicking in the center of the box in the side view(lower right pane).
12. Hit the "left square bracket key" two times to reduce the grid size to 16.
13. Drag each side of the wall out by 1 grid in the side view (lower right pane, using the small white dots).
14. Right click the end wall and select "tie to entity" (or hit CTRL+T).
15. In the dialog change the class to portal, then ...
16. Select Ambient Light, and change the drop-down option to "Passes through", close dialog.
17. Save the file in C:\test\ call it "myfirstroom" (menu file/save as, the file will get a .rmf extension by default).

Open the compile dialog (F9 or menu file/run) hit the expert button at the bottom.
Select edit, create a new configuration by hitting the "New" button, name it Torque
Ensure the new Torque config is selected in the "Configurations:" drop-down list.

hit the New button
On the right hit the Cmds Button and select CSG program option

Copy the following and paste and in the parameters: dialog.

-v -h -o $path -t $path $path\$file.$ext

Select the tick box next to $csg_exe in the Compile/run commands pane, then Hit Go! button to create the DIF file.

myfirstroom.dif will be located in c:\test

notes:

$path in the above config points to where you saved/loaded the rmf file.

You can change -o $path to -o C:\Torque_SDK\example\starter.fps\data\interiors\test (don't forget to create the test directory interiors\test!).

You can change -t $path to -o C:\Torque_SDK\example\starter.fps\data\interiors for the textures.

Hope this saves you some time .....

I got lost in like 4 places trying to do this, not really sure how helpful this is i cant seem to get them to export correctly and i dont know enough about valve to make the box work correctly other than that i suppose its a good resource

Very helpful.
Thankyou!

Luke Hopkins   (Jan 16, 2006 at 21:46 GMT)
hey can u plz plz help me ive managed to complie my map and it works in torque it just my box is textureless how do i get the texture to show up

Luke:

Make sure you have copied the textures to your interiors folder.

ie example\starter.fps\data\interiors

replace starter.fps with whatever mod folder you are using.

Luke Hopkins   (Jan 17, 2006 at 13:59 GMT)
ive done that, is there any percif type of texture, where do the diff file call the texure from becuase i could look an see where it is lookin for the texture

This tutorial has me hopping around the room in glee! I've been using Worldcraft for some years, resently upgraded to Hammer, if I can get this working well, I'll be able to knock out some quality buildings. I'll resource anything nice I come up with.

Cheers for your time mate, I'll make sure I feed something back into the community!

Luke (Soul) Horobin   (Jan 17, 2006 at 21:01 GMT)   Resource Rating: 5
Having the same problem as the other Luke, how perfect. Trying to sort it, will try and get an answer and post back here, in the mean time, other Luke, if you fixed it, mind posting up how? Save me a night fiddling no end!

Thanks

*Edit*

Ok, 5 mins later and one site search. I have it working Luke mate, follow this tutorial. It doesn't seem to add much, but what it did seemed to work. Well, it was either that, or me copying my .wad and .jpg of my texture to several places. Have a play with where your textures are stored mate. Thinking about it, I think the .wad is only used for hammer.. not sure, will play.

The wad file is only used by Hammer.
Torque needs the files you used to make the wad file.
Place the textures in the same directory as the dif file OR the directory above.

Torque supports the following formats for the texture files: GIF, JPG, PNG

This saved me a TON of time... Thanks for putting this up!

Louden   (Feb 10, 2006 at 13:20 GMT)
I am doing something wrong, when I go to create the test room I get this error. I am guessing that it has something to do with the way I have set up my directories for the files.

** Executing...
** Command: 4

I had the same problem last week, I have no idea what is causing this !

what location did you save the rmf file ?

Veynom   (Mar 10, 2006 at 05:03 GMT)
this worked for me


-v -h -o E:\Torque\SDK\example\VeynomShroud\data\interiors -t E:\Torque\SDK\example\VeynomShroud\data\interiors\textures $path\$file.$ext

The link www.garagegames.com/mg/projects/tge/artist.php#DIF is broken. It doesn't do anything but give a blank page. Is that file still available?

Try here, this is the Dif compiler that I currently use.

Great tutorial. It helps our team get a handle on creating artistic content.
About textures---> be careful with your naming conventions.... textures that end in a number do not register properly and won't show up. I figured that one after a couple of head-aches.

Kurt Schaeffer   (Apr 03, 2006 at 03:23 GMT)
The author left out a couple of steps in an otherwise very good write up. It may be because of things in a later release of Hammer, but here goes:

In the Options dialog, you must add a new game configuration and give it a name (like "Torque") by hitting the Edit button (I must say this is an obtuse design decision in an otherwise great editor). Then you must hit the Add button and browse for the aforementioned torque.fgd in the directory you created under the Hammer install.

Jerry Casian   (Apr 22, 2006 at 18:52 GMT)
Does this work with version 3.4? Everytime I go to file/new It tell me I dont have a game configured and It opends the option box again. Then when I check the build programs tab, the CSG .exe I chose Is not there anymore. I basically did everything here.

Vis   (Apr 22, 2006 at 19:47 GMT)   Resource Rating: 3
@Jerry:
This resource was created using 3.4; are you using windows XP home edition by any chance ?

@Kurt:
Did you place the torque.fdg as stated ? I found that Hammer picks it up and theres no need for the steps you suggest.

If it's map2dif giving you problems it's because you need a couple of parameters when running the program. It has no GUI. If that's the problem I can quickly make a GUI for it, assuming you have java. I'm still not good enough with C++.

At any rate. The syntax for the map2Dif program is (this is my version might've changed)

map2dif_debug.exe -o [output dir] -t [texture dir] [file].map

so the commandline I had to input to convert one of my standard 2x2 bouncy platforms (for use in my mod) I had to type

map2dif_debug -o . -t "d:\games\marble Blast\marble\data\interiors" normal2x2.map

I input the . because it should just be output to this directory, used quotes because I had a space in my path to the textures (in 98 I could've just done marble~1 instead). Also notice that I didn't end the path with a \ this would've caused the program to act as if it didn't work.

I of course ran the file from the same directory as map2dif_debug was in and with the .map file too. This is the response I got

Successfully opened map file: normal2x2.map
Parsing mapfile...done.
Creating BSP...done.
Marking active zones...done
Creating surfaces...done.
Lightmaps: Normal...Alarm...done.
Resorting and Packing LightMaps...done.

STATISTICS
- Total brushes: 1
+ structural: 1
+ detail: 0
+ portal: 0
- Number of zones: 1
- Number of surfaces: 6

Exporting to runtime...done.

Writing Resource: persist..(./normal2x2.dif) Done.

I guess that's how a successful build should look.

This post just a sort of afterthought.
