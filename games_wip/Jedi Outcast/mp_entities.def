DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.

If an item is the target of another entity, it will not spawn in until fired.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"notteam" if set to 1, don't spawn in team games
"notsingle" if set to 1, don't spawn in single player games
"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
"random" random number of plus or minus seconds varied from the respawn time
"count" override quantity or duration on most items.

"wait" : Seconds between triggerings, 0.5 default, -1 = one time only.
"random"	wait variance, default is 0
Variable sized repeatable trigger.  Must be targeted at one or more entities.
so, the basic time between firing is a random time between
(wait - random) and (wait + random)

/*QUAKED trigger_always (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
This trigger will always fire.  It is activated by the world.
*/


/*QUAKED trigger_push (.5 .5 .5) ?
Must point at a target_position, which will be the apex of the leap.
This will be client side predicted, unlike target_push
*/


/*QUAKED target_push (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) bouncepad
Pushes the activator in the direction.of angle, or towards a target apex.
"speed"		defaults to 1000
if "bouncepad", play bounce noise instead of windfly
*/


/*QUAKED trigger_teleport (.5 .5 .5) ? SPECTATOR
Allows client side prediction of teleportation events.
Must point at a target_position, which will be the teleport destination.

If spectator is set, only spectators can use this teleport
Spectator teleporters are not normally placed in the editor, but are created
automatically near doors to allow spectators to move through them

/*QUAKED trigger_hurt (.5 .5 .5) ? START_OFF CAN_TARGET SILENT NO_PROTECTION SLOW
Any entity that touches this will be hurt.
It does dmg points of damage each server frame
Targeting the trigger will toggle its on / off state.

SILENT			supresses playing the sound
SLOW			changes the damage rate to once per second
NO_PROTECTION	*nothing* stops the damage

"dmg"			default 5 (whole numbers only)
If dmg is set to -1 this brush will use the fade-kill method

/*QUAKED func_timer (0.3 0.1 0.6) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) START_ON
This should be renamed trigger_timer...
Repeatedly fires its targets.
Can be turned on or off by using.

"wait"			base time between triggering all targets, default is 1
"random"		wait variance, default is 0
so, the basic time between firing is a random time between
(wait - random) and (wait + random)
