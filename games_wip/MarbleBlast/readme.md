OpenMBU is a reverse engineered version of Marble Blast Ultra that is based on Torque Shader Engine 0.9 (MS4). This add-on should work for previous [MarbleBlastUltra PC](https://old.marblevortex.com/game/download/) big release or [OpenMBU](https://github.com/MBU-Team/OpenMBU/).

### Information
Currently this add-on is setup to look for textures and maps in the same dir. This may change in the future, but this is copying what I thought I saw other tools doing. I am early in my MarbleBlastUltra level making journey, only discovering this game this last month. Things will likely change...

## Install Instructions (brief)

Place the MarbleBlast dir inside your TB games dir.

For Linux that could be `~./TrenchBroom/games/` dir.

For Win that could be `c:\games\MarbleBlastUltra\Trenchbroom\games\` or where ever your games path where you extracted TrenchBroom is.

After that is completed, open TrenchBroom, on the top toolbar go `View-->Preferences`, select `MarbleBlast` from the left hand side list of games and set your `Game Path` to where your map and textures are kept in one dir.


<br><sub>I will add more to this later, still a WIP. TB is crashing when setting engine or tool paths which requires further investigation.</sub>
